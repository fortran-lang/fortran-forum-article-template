# Introduction

## Background and motivation

_ACM SIGPLAN Fortran Forum_ holds a unique place in the literature as a newsletter dedicated to the world's oldest programming language.
For nearly forty years, _Fortran Forum_ has chronicled the language that brings the world its weather and climate predictions [@skamarock2008description;@danabasoglu2020community] and supports the design of power plants [@geelhood2011fraptran] and vehicles that traverse land, air, and space [@cifuentes2012using;@biedron2019fun3d].
When _Fortran Forum_ published its inaugural issue under the name _ForTec Forum_, FORTRAN was still spelled in upper case and was "the most widely used programming language" according to an article by founding Editor Loren Meissner [@meissner1982fortran].
Since then, _Fortran Forum_ has published a mix of research articles, columns, and news with the most highly cited research articles garnering nearly 1,000 citations since publication [@numrich1998co].

A successful publication venue must attracts a steady stream of article submissions.
One hurdle to submitting lies in the the energy barrier imposed by context-switching between doing work and writing about work.
In many writing workflows, the process of writing an article about programming bears little resemblance to the process of programming.
Writing code and writing articles exercise different skill sets and employ different tools.
Thus, an interest and ability to write code does not necessarily translate into an interest and ability to write articles about code.

Another obstacle lies in the article review process or the lack thereof.
Some authors are less likely to submit if a venue requires peer review.
Other authors are less likely to submit to a venue that does _not_ require peer review.
Promotion and tenure at research universities, for example, necessitates producing a body of peer-reviewed publications.
Hence, providing avenues for both sets of potential authors expands the authorship pool.

## Objectives
With the git repository template that generated this article, we aim to address the aforementioned barriers by demonstrating an article development approach that

1. Leverages widely used software development tools and workflows so that article construction mirrors software writing, building, and testing;
2. Employs these same tools and workflows to facilitate an _optional_ and _optionally open_ peer-review process; and
3. Integrates the code development and article development into one seamless process in which the scripts that build and test the article also build and test the code described in the article.

We hope this process lowers the barrier to article writing by making the process feel natural and familiar to programmers.
One outcome of this process is a higher degree of automation of tedious activities such as spell-checking and document formatting.

# Methodology

## The Article Template

This article template is formatted in GitHub-flavored [Markdown] with embedded LaTeX, an approach that balances syntactical simplicity with powerful automation and rich rendering.
Markdown provides a lightweight, memorable syntax for expressing document structure in a format that remains readable even in its raw, unprocessed form.
This makes learning Markdown straightorward and writing it efficient.

Additionally, Markdown is well supported by a large variety of tools,
meaning authors will not have a difficult time using it with their favorite editors.
It also means there are a large number of resources available for learning about it,
and for helping to troubleshoot any issues that might be encountered.

Also, because Markdown is stored as plain text, it is convenient for version control systems.
This makes tracking changes easy, and enables a process of collaboration familiar to our target authors: programmers.
The authors of this article have had much success collaborating on projects
using Markdown and version control.

## The Template Repository

The authors chose to store this template in a GitHub repository for several reasons.
First, this allows the template to be publicly available and thus obtaining a copy is easy.
In fact, by utilizing GitHub's Template Repository feature,
getting started writing a new article with the template is practically as simple as clicking a button.

Next, storing the template as a GitHub repository makes it easy for users to submit feedback.
Anyone can [open an issue] to report a bug, or suggest changes that should be made.
Anyone can also contribute directly to improving the template by [submitting a pull request].

Finally, GitHub provides convenient facilities for automation in a git repository.
As described later in this article, we make significant use of this feature to check a variety of things.
This helps to reduce the burden on both authors and the editors, as well as catch simple mistakes.

## How the Template Works

Click the "Use This Template" button in the [article template repository] to create your own copy.
You write your article in the provided template file (this file), using Markdown format.
You can also add additional references to the included `bibliography.bib` file in bibtex format,
and then cite those references as demonstrated below.
All of this editing can be done in a web browser via GitHub,
but if you're familiar with git can be done in whatever method is most convenient for you.

For every commit made to your repository, the provided CI script (`.github/workflows/CI.yml`) will convert your article to a pdf
that can be downloaded from the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub
by clicking on the most recent run and looking for the "Artifacts" section.
If you are working on your own machine and have `pandoc` and \LaTeX installed,
you can generate the same preview locally using the command found in the "Render Paper" section of the CI script.

## Some Additional Features

In addition to most of the usual features of Markdown, such as headings, bulleted and numbered lists, and hyperlinks,
this template supports some features also required for producing quality articles.

### Citations

Invariably, any article will need to cite prior work.
This is done by including an entry for the reference you would like to cite in the `bibliography.bib` file.
Then, within the text of the article, citations are made using [rMarkdown] syntax,
as illustrated below for quick reference.

- `@cifuentes2012using`  ->  @cifuentes2012using
- `[@berna1997frapcon]` -> [@berna1997frapcon]
- `[@biedron2019fun3d; @danabasoglu2020community]` -> [@biedron2019fun3d; @danabasoglu2020community]

### Figures With Captions and References

Quite frequently it is desirable to include a figure within an article, and refer to it within the text.
This can be done similarly to regular Markdown, but with some additional syntax as shown below.
The results of this can then be seen in \autoref{fig:example}, with the reference to it generated with the syntax `\autoref{fig:example}`.

```
![The Fortran logo from fortran-lang.org\label{fig:example}](Fortran-logo.png){ width=20% }
```

![The Fortran logo from fortran-lang.org\label{fig:example}](Fortran-logo.png){ width=20% }

### Equations

Another aspect quite frequently used in articles is mathematics.
One can use single dollar signs (`$`) to delimit inline mathematics.
For example, `$e = m c^2$` will be rendered as $e = m c^2$.

Double dollar signs can be used to make self-standing equations,
as illustrated by the syntax below being rendered into the equation that follows.

```
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
+ \left( u \cdot \nabla \right) u
- \nu \nabla^2 u
= \nabla w + g
$$
```

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
+ \left( u \cdot \nabla \right) u
- \nu \nabla^2 u
= \nabla w + g
$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations, as illustrated by the syntax below,
and rendered into \autoref{eq:boltzmann}, referred to by the syntax `\autoref{eq:boltzmann}`.

```
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmann}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
+ \overrightarrow{v_1} \cdot \nabla_{\overrightarrow{r}}
+ \frac{\overrightarrow{K}}{m} \cdot \nabla_{\overrightarrow{v_1}} \right) f_1
= \int d\Omega \int d\overrightarrow{v_2} \sigma\left(\Omega\right)
\left| \overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2} \right|
\left( f_1'f_2' - f_1f_2 \right)
\end{equation}
```

\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmann}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
+ \overrightarrow{v_1} \cdot \nabla_{\overrightarrow{r}}
+ \frac{\overrightarrow{K}}{m} \cdot \nabla_{\overrightarrow{v_1}} \right) f_1
= \int d\Omega \int d\overrightarrow{v_2} \sigma\left(\Omega\right)
\left| \overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2} \right|
\left( f_1'f_2' - f_1f_2 \right)
\end{equation}

### Source Code

In a journal about a programming language, one invariably needs to include some source code.
You can write code inline by enclosing it in single back-ticks like \`code\` -> `code`.
You can also write multi-line snippets of code directly in the document by including a line of three back-ticks before and after.
The result looks something like the following.

```
x = y + z
if (thing) then
    call do_something()
else
    call do_other()
end if
```

While the above methods work and are acceptable,
we highly recommend writing your source code in separate files.
The CI script will then compile and possibly run, any of your code to ensure it works.
We use the [Fortran Package Manager] to do so.
You can then include the file by having an empty code block (i.e. two lines of three back-ticks),
but on the first line, after the back-ticks include syntax like `{include=src/library_s.f90}`.
We use the external pandoc filter [`pandoc-include-code`], which also has options for including portions of the named file.

```{include=src/library_s.f90}
```

# Submitting an Article

The process of writing and submitting an article can now become much simpler.
No longer will you need to battle with word processor template or fight with the difficulties of \LaTeX.
Formatting is not something the author must worry about.
Just write the content.

To submit an article for publication, follow the instructions described in the previous section to write your article.
Once your article is ready to review, contact the editors of the Journal at ???,
and make sure that they have access to view the repository with your article.
If you elect to have your article peer reviewed prior to publication, you will also need to grant access to the reviewers.
Any review comments will be submitted as GitHub Issues.
Once all review comments have been satisfactorily addressed, the editors will be able to include your article in the next issue of the journal.

# Automated Checks

The template repository comes with several automated checks in place.
These checks are executed for any change that is pushed to the repository.
The script that executes them is stored in the repository at `.github/workflows/CI.yml`.
The script uses only open-source and easily available software,
so the same commands can be used locally.
The script can also be edited, if some reason an article has some different, specific requirements.
Note however than any significant changes to the process of rendering the article to a pdf may present a barrier to having it published.

The first check, and of primary importance is that the paper is rendered to pdf and made available to download for preview.
As noted earlier, this preview can be downloaded from the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub.
This should dramatically reduce the chance of having articles submitted which the editors are unable to render for publication.

Next, a spell checker is used to check the contents of the paper for spelling errors.
Any misspelled words are reported.
This should help find spelling errors earlier in the writing process, and help reduce the chances that any make it to publication.

# Peer Review
The editor would prefer that the review process be open (public)
as a way of encouraging reviewers and authors to be on good behavior.
This also allows prospective new authors to see how the process works
and not be turned off by fear of the unknown.

Finally, by having much of the process automated and encouraging authors to utilize the template,
it can alleviate some of the burden on the editors for producing new issues of the journal.
This can help ensure a regular publication schedule, without which new authors might not be attracted.
It can also ensure that the publication adheres to a consistent style and has a quality format,
also something beneficial for attracting prospective authors.

Finally, any Fortran source code will be compiled and possibly executed.
The [Fortran Package Manager] (fpm) is used to alleviate the burden on authors of putting together their own build system.
See its documentation for the specifics of its use.
This should help avoid the publication of source code and examples that contain errors.
